=head1 NAME

Search::OpenSearch::FeedParser - parse Search::OpenSearch::Response::XML 

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.100';

my $XMLer       = Search::Tools::XML->new();
my $XML_ESCAPER = Data::Transformer->new(
    normal => sub { local ($_) = shift; $$_ = $XMLer->escape($$_); } );

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Search::OpenSearch::FeedParser;
 my $parser = Search::OpenSearch::FeedParser->new();
 my $feed = $parser->parse( $sos_response );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search::OpenSearch::FeedParser is the client parser for Search::OpenSearch::Response::XML.
It is similar in concept to WWW::OpenSearch but because the SOS::Response::XML format
is a superset of the OpenSearch standard, this module implements a different API.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( I<args> )

Instantiate a new FeedParser object. You can re-use a single FeedParser object to parse
multiple responses.

I<args> should be a hash of key/value pairs, including:

=over

=item debug I<bool>

=item fields I<arrayref>

=back

=cut

=head2 debug([I<bool>])

Get/set the debug flag for the parser.

=head2 fields

Get/set the arrayref of field names the parser should expect in each response.

=head2 parse( I<sos_response> )

Parse the contents of I<sos_response> and return a Search::OpenSearch::Feed object.
I<sos_response> may be a string of XML or a Search::OpenSearch::Response::XML object.
